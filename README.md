# Pong-Keras-ReinforcementLearning
## 1.The project that used keras and gym to try to build a model to training in the game Pong.
## 2.Everoments : you shoud install the keras, gym, h5py, theano, and ofcourse the tensorflow.
## 3.I trained this model for 3 weeks, but it eventhouth cant win the AI. 
I tried to change the learning rate and outher hyperparameters dueing the training time, but it not so useful.
So i decide to change a model to train, that i had lost my patient to going on.
## 4.I was tolded that i will win the AI by training over one or two month by using my mac, but its not efficient.
